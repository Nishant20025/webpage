Nature is everything around us that helps us live and makes the world beautiful. 
It includes the air we breathe, the water we drink, the trees, animals, mountains, and rivers. 
Nature is like a mother because it gives us food, fresh air, and shelter. 
]The sun gives us light and warmth, trees give us oxygen, and rivers give us water.
Being in nature makes us feel calm and happy. A simple walk outside or hearing birds
 sing can make us feel fresh and peaceful. But today, we are cutting down too many 
trees and polluting the air and water, which is harming nature. This has caused problems like climate 
change and the loss of animals.Nature has always been here, but we often forget how important it is. If we don’t 
protect it, future generations will suffer. We can take care of nature by planting 
trees, saving water, and keeping our surroundings clean. Small things like using less plastic and throwing waste 
properly can make a big difference.In short, nature is a gift we should respect and protect. If we 
care for nature, we can make the world a better and greener place for everyone.
